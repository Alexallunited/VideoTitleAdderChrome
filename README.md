# Video Title Adder for Chrome&trade;

## Update 2019-10-29:

As per today, the extension has been taken off the web store. I was contacted by YouTube with regards to an API audit of the project, and I simply do not have the time or energy to go through their audit process for what I consider simply a fun side project. I'm sorry to all the users of the extension it inconveniences.

If anyone else wishes to pick up the project and take it from here, you have my blessing. 

Notes for a future project maintainer: The project is in working order at the time of writing. If you choose to pick up the project, you will need to review the [YouTube API Services - Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) and bring the extension into compliance. Once thing it for sure lacks is a privacy policy.
